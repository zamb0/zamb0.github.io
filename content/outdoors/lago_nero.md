The day before the hike, I was in the mood for a via ferrata climb, and I remembered that there were two routes near Lago Nero. It had been quite a while since I last hiked in the Piacenza area, so I decided to revisit the region. I found a great trail starting from Rocca d'Aveto that would take me to the summit of Monte Roncalla via the first ferrata, the [Adolfo Ferrari](https://www.ferrate365.it/vie-ferrate/ferrata-adolfo-ferrari-roncalla/). From there, I planned to continue past Lago Nero to reach the second via ferrata, the [Mazzocchi](https://www.ferrate365.it/vie-ferrate/ferrata-mazzocchi-monte-nero-val-aveto/). The hike would conclude at Rocca d'Aveto, passing through Prato Cipolla—a lovely meadow perfect for a break before returning to the car.

Unfortunately, after checking the weather forecast, I realized that it had been raining for several days, leaving the rock surfaces wet. Wet rocks on a via ferrata are incredibly dangerous! So, I decided to modify the route and skip the ferratas altogether. I would still do a similar hike but replace Monte Roncalla with Monte Groppo Rosso.

I wasn’t alone on this adventure—my friend and sister joined me. We started the hike by descending a path that led us to a small stream, a tributary of the Fossato Grosso. After crossing the Fossato Grosso, we began the climb up Monte Groppo Rosso. The ascent was steep, so we had to stop a few times to catch our breath. As we gained altitude, we noticed the vegetation gradually shift from dense woodland typical of the area to more alpine flora. Once at the summit of Monte Groppo Rosso, we were rewarded with a stunning view of the surrounding mountains, including Monte Roncalla, Monte Bue, and Monte Nero.

We decided to postpone lunch and continue our hike toward Lago Nero. The trail was easy, with some minor ups and downs but nothing too challenging. On the way, we passed by the Rifugio Astass and the Fontana Gelata, a small waterfall where the water was so cold it was almost impossible to touch. Interestingly, the nearby fountain where you can refill your water bottles was dry.

When we finally reached Lago Nero, we stopped for lunch. The lake was beautiful, and by pure coincidence, we ran into some friends who were there as well. After lunch and a quick nap, we continued on to Prato Cipolla. The path—used as a ski slope in winter—was steep and downhill, so we had to be careful not to slip.

At Prato Cipolla, we enjoyed a snack and a beer at the Rifugio Prato Cipolla. The meadow was gorgeous, surrounded by picturesque mountains. We also discovered a nearby climbing crag, which we’re definitely planning to return to. ([Falesia Dente della Cipolla](https://www.gulliver.it/itinerari/dente-della-cipolla/))

After our break, we began the descent back to Rocca d'Aveto. The path was straightforward but still a bit steep in places, and we arrived at the car in about an hour.
