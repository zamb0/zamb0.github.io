I was so exited for this one, my first snowshoeing experience! I had been wanting to try it for a while, and after some life changes, I finally had the opportunity. The CAI section of Pavia organized a snowshoeing trip to Ceresole Reale, and I immediately signed up. I even signed up for the next one, which will take place the next weekend. Fortunately, the CAI section provides snowshoes for those who don’t have them, so I didn’t have to worry about renting or buying a pair.

As usual, I woke up early on Sunday morning and walked to the meeting point. The bus was already there, and the group was ready to go. We left Pavia at 7:00 am and arrived in Ceresole Reale around 11:00 am. Yes, 4 hours on a bus! The driver chose the wrong route, and we ended up taking a detour. But we finally made it, and the weather was perfect—sunny and not so cold, with fresh snow on the ground. The guide explained the route, and we started our adventure.
But not before a ARTVA check! The guide explained how to use the ARTVA, and we all checked our devices. Safety first!

The trail started on a steep slope, and I was a bit unsure about my snowshoes. I had never used them before, and I was afraid of slipping. But after a few steps, I got the hang of it. The snowshoes provided excellent traction, and I felt safe. We were late from the start, so we had to hurry to reach the Rifugio Jervis. The guide set a fast pace, and we followed him, trying to keep up. The trail was beautiful, with snow-covered trees and the frozen lakes. We stopped a few times to take pictures, but we didn’t linger too long.

When we finally reached the Rifugio Jervis, we were starving. The rifugio's kitchen was already closed, fortunatelly we had brought some sandwiches and snacks. After a quick lunch, we continued our hike down to the valley. The descent was another challenge, as the trail was steep and slippery. I was glad I had my snowshoes, even if i felt a bit unsteady at times. But I made it down safely, and we arrived back in Ceresole Reale around 4:00 pm. The bus was waiting for us, and we headed back to Pavia.
