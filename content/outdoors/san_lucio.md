A friend of mine needed to return something to Clusone and invited my sister and me to join her for the trip. We agreed, and the plan was to hike to Pizzo Formico and then have lunch at a chalet owned by a friend of hers.

The hike started off nicely. We walked through the woods on a gentle path that wasn’t too steep. Soon, we reached a meadow called Pianone, where cows were grazing peacefully. As we continued, the trail gradually became steeper. After passing Forcella Larga, the terrain grew rockier and more challenging as we approached the summit.

Once we reached the top, we were rewarded with a stunning view of the valley and the surrounding mountains. From there, we took a different route down, passing by Torrente Valle Gavazzo. Unfortunately, we stumbled upon a dead deer along the way, likely killed by a wolf. The smell in the area was quite unpleasant.

Eventually, we made it to the chalet, where we enjoyed a delicious lunch with a group of my friend’s friends. The return trip was much easier, taking us through the woods and then along a dirt road. We soon arrived back at the car and headed home.
