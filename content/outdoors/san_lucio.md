A friend of mine had to return something to a friend in Clusone and invited my sister and me to join her for the trip. We agreed and the plan was to hike to Formico Peak and then have lunch at a friend's cabin.

The hike started well. We walked through the forest on a gentle path that was not too steep. Soon we reached a meadow called Pianone, where cows were quietly grazing. As we continued, the trail gradually became steeper. After passing Forcella Larga, the terrain became rockier and more challenging as we approached the summit.

Once we reached the summit, we were rewarded with beautiful views of the valley and surrounding mountains. From there, we took another road downhill past the Valle Gavazzo stream. Unfortunately, along the way we came across a dead deer, probably killed by a wolf. The smell in the area was quite unpleasant.

Eventually we arrived at the chalet, where we enjoyed a delicious lunch with a group of my friend's friends. The return was much easier, going through the woods and then down a dirt road. Before long we were back at the car and headed home.
