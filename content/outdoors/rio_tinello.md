I went bouldering at Rio Tinello with a friend, and it was our first time climbing outdoors. The area is located near Chiarone, in Val Tidone (Piacenza). We spent the day tackling several routes, enjoying both the challenge and the excitement of climbing in nature. The weather was perfect and we had fun pushing on the rocks, enjoying the beautiful scenery and peaceful atmosphere of the valley.

It was a fun and relaxing day, but I look forward to going back, this time more prepared. I definitely need to work on my technique and strength to cope better outdoors. At the end of the day, we managed to close three problems each, graded around 5a. We also attempted a 5c and a 6a+, but could not complete them.

The boulder area is well documented on the dedicated [web page](https://riotinello.blogspot.com/), which provided us with all the information we needed to find the place and get started. We also met some other climbers who were friendly and helpful, making the experience even better. I look forward to returning to explore more of what the area has to offer.
