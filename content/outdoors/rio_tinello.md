I went bouldering at Rio Tinello with a friend, and it was our first time climbing outdoors. The area is located near Chiarone, in the Tidone Valley (Piacenza). We spent the day tackling different routes, enjoying both the challenge and the thrill of climbing in nature. The weather was perfect, and we had a fantastic time pushing ourselves on the rocks while soaking in the beautiful scenery and peaceful atmosphere of the valley.

It was a fun and relaxing day, but I’m already looking forward to going back—this time, better prepared. I definitely need to work on my technique and strength to tackle outdoor problems more effectively. By the end of the day, we managed to close three problems each, graded around 5a. We also attempted a 5c and a 6a+ but couldn’t quite manage to complete it.

The bouldering area is well-documented on its dedicated webpage, which gave us all the information we needed to find the spot and get started. We even met a few other climbers who were friendly and helpful, making the experience even better. I can't wait to return and explore more of what the area has to offer.
