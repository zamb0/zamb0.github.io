Here you can find post related to my outdoor adventures. I love to hike, climb, camp, and explore the great outdoors. I will share my experiences, tips, and tricks with you. I hope you enjoy reading my posts and that they inspire you to get outside and explore the world around you.

Each post will be tagged with the *activity* tag (e.g. climb, hike, etc.) so you can easily find all the content related to outdoor adventures.

I will also include photos and gps to help bring my experiences to life.
